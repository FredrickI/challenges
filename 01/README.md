# Word Values Challenge Part I

Word Values is a scrabble game that takes a dictionary word and calculates the value. 

You can also take a list of words and find which one has the highest value. If no word is given it defaults to calculate the 

the max value from the dictionary.

Use the test_wordvalue.py to verify it works.
